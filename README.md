# Personal Synopsis

I am currently in my final semester of the masters in computer science program at SUNY New Paltz.
I have been interested in technology all of my life.  In middle school when everyone was still listening to walkmen 
I mowed lawns and saved for two summers to buy an mp3 player (5 years before the release of the ipod).  I was also 
very interested in business and I was always on the look out for ways to combine my love for tech and my passion for
making money.  I capitalized on the previously mentioned cd market and purchased an external cd writing drive and
began selling custom cds to anyone with $10 and a playlist (to any and all law enforcement agencies
reading, this is not an admission of guilt of piracy).  When cd writing became mainstream tech, I realized how
quickly the consumer market was able to move and I upgraded to a dvd burner to out pace my competition.

When it came time to make selections for my undergraduate studies I made the regrettable decision to study business
rather than computer science.  My decision was my own but I was GREATLY influenced by parents. They are quite traditional 
and fearful of technology and said I would never get a job in computers and finance/accounting was a safer bet.  
My parents were not wrong about the availability of jobs in the accounting field but they were wrong about the impending 
explosion of tech jobs!  My first job out of college was as an analyst for Johnson & Johnson's pharmaceutical division.  
I didn't realize it at the time but this would be my first opportunity to apply some of my tech skills in a professional 
capacity.  My team, like many did most of their work in excel.  Through a bit of conniving and relentless
begging I was able to convince my manager to let me prioritize my goal of automating all recurring analytical movements 
with visual basic macros It was a resounding success!  It was my first taste of solving problems with tech and I was 
hooked.

Hindsight is 20/20 and I know now that my youthful energy was only exceeded by my headstrong arrogance.  I quit my
job with J&J to pursue an accounting position with a modest (short term) financial gain and a shorter 
commute (a fools move). I am the first to admit that I have floundered around in the accounting field for far too long.  
I knew I needed a  structured academic computer science program and a degree to go with it.  Unfortunately we live in 
a world where there are no handouts and I prefer to live in doors when it is cold so quitting my job to attend school 
full time was not an option.  After 4 years I finally built up enough equity  with my current company and they allowed 
me to adjust my work schedule to miss 2 days a week (as long as I commit a minimum of 40 hours and come in on Saturday).  
I was drawn to New Paltz because of it's pristine reputation and the scheduling  potential to block 3 courses a 
semester into 2 days a week.  I have made the absolute most of those 2 days a week for the last year by studying 
Data Structures, Computer Systems, Database design, Algorithms, Operating Systems and Foundations of Computer Science.

A traditional in classroom program is exactly what I needed.  I have taken everything I have learned in school and applied 
it to all facets of my job.  I have designed and implemented a number of programs that have made my job more accurate and 
more efficient.  My pride and joy is a payroll accuracy checking software that has identified over $200 million dollars 
worth of erroneous payments that have all been recouped and applied directly to the bottom line.  My goal is to one day 
sell my payroll software to all of the major heavy civil construction companies both in the NYC area and beyond.  At this 
stage in the game all I have completed is the back end and it seems very challenging if not impossible to market a java 
program  that needs to be executed on a computers command line to multi million/billion dollar companies.  That is where 
both client and server web programming.  It has become clear now that my program is perfect for implementing as a 
web service!   you come in professor Plotkin!  Based on our first couple of classes I can tell that you are going to 
provide a very  sturdy  foundation in I hope to use the information I learn in your class to grow my product into 
something I can sell.  If everything goes  according to plan (which I'm sure it won't), sales of my software will allow 
me to truly go out on my own and start my own software company.  From there the sky is the limit!
