  "description": "I am currently in my final semester of the masters in computer science program at SUNY New Paltz.\r I have been interested in technology all of my life.  In middle school when everyone was still listening to walkmen \r I mowed lawns and saved for two summers to buy an mp3 player (5 years before the release of the ipod).  I was also \r very interested in business and I was always on the look out for ways to combine my love for tech and my passion for\r making money.  I capitalized on the previously mentioned cd market and purchased an external cd writing drive and\r began selling custom cds to anyone with $10 and a playlist (to any and all law enforcement agencies\r reading, this is not an admission of guilt of piracy).  When cd writing became mainstream tech, I realized how\r quickly the consumer market was able to move and I upgraded to a dvd burner to out pace my competition.",
